# Deep Learning Lab

As computation power increases everyday, models that are more complex and can process more data become possible. This field, better known as deep learning is
a subset of Machine Learning, the buzz world in the industry and academia alike, with some added benefits. In Machine Learning tasks, the programmer must
generate features from the data before using a mathematical model to fit the data. In deep learning however, the model itself learns important features from the data.
Much more complicated functions can be modelled and hence, a myriad of tasks become possible. In this lab, you will learn some of those tasks, ranging from
undersanding images to comprehend natural language. You will learn to solve these tasks using two of the most pervasive platforms,namely Keras and Pytorch.

The lab is divided broadly into three parts:
 - Vision - This part involves processing image dataset to make various inferences. Training the model to identify what the image represents, highlighting 
 a particular object in it, identifying  certain objects in an image, transferring art styles from one painting to the other and son are examples where images are taken as inputs and models should be able to successfully 'see' them.
 - Natural Language Processing - This part involves understanding the language spoken by humans. We all have been taught that the computer understands only '1's and '0's, but in these tasks, you will see that it is also possible for the computer to understand human language by finding patterns in the dataset and representing them in binary('1's and '0's). Some examples of this section include Language to Language translation, Extracting Answers to Questions in a Language, Identifying emotions from reviews and so on  
 - Autoencoders and GANs - These are some additional exercises which are a bit different from the much bigger domains of Vision and Natural Language. These are generative models, or models which create images or text, instead of making any decisions based on them. They can be useful for various tasks like anomaly detection, where general trends are created and an alert is issued in case of aberrant behaviour.
 
 More details about these are as follows:
 
 ## Lab 1 - MNIST Classification
 
 In this lab, you will build a model in Keras for classifying images of handwritten digits(0-9). This task is known as multi-class classification and
 is useful for various applications such as classification of diseases based on X-Rays in Medical Science to classifying bird sounds in zoology.
 You will build a simple Convolutional Network for this purpose.

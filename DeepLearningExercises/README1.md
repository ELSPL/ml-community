# Deep Learning Lab

As computation power increases everyday, models that are more complex and can process more data become possible. This field, better known as deep learning is
a subset of Machine Learning, the buzz world in the industry and academia alike, with some added benefits. In Machine Learning tasks, the programmer must
generate features from the data before using a mathematical model to fit the data. In deep learning however, the model itself learns important features from the data.
Much more complicated functions can be modelled and hence, a myriad of tasks become possible. In this lab, you will learn some of those tasks, ranging from
undersanding images to comprehend natural language. You will learn to solve these tasks using two of the most pervasive platforms,namely Keras and Pytorch.

The lab is divided broadly into three parts:
 - Vision
 - Natural Language Processing
 - Autoencoders and GANs
 
 More details about these are as follows:

## Purpose of Lab
  - This Lab continues on the track set by LAB 1 and uses second order optimization techniques like newton's method.
  - Learn statistics (the bayesian approach as well as the frequentist approach) and probability. 
  - Introduction and usage of statistical models like MLE, MAP  using naive bayesian and so on.

## Purpose of Lab
This lab is the first lab for machine learning concepts. This Lab deals with Linear and Polynomial Regression, one of the most popular machine learning algorithms. This algorithm is used for prediction(For eg. house prices, stock prices etc.).
The lab will cover various techniques used for regresson, namely normal equation and gradient descent. Main focus will be on mathematical topics of first order optimization.
The later part of thee Lab will focus on the classification problems using the concept of Support Vector Machines(SVM). This will give us a sneak-peek into the topics of the second lab i.e. second order optimization. We will use the cvxopt library to solve the quadratic programming problem of the SVM algorithm.

## Brief Introduction of exercises

1.) Resources section
  - Learn the math behind the Gradient Descent and Normal Equation
  - Learn the basic workflow of the Linear and Polynomial Regression
  
2.) Linear_regression_and_Polynomial_Regression, Linreg
  - Learn about the concept from example notebooks. The notebooks contain visual representations based on toy data as well as usage on real data. Implementation from scratch as well as using sk-learn is done.
  
3.) Resources(SVM)
  - Learn the algorithm and math behind SVM
  
4.) SVM
  - Example notebook on SVM using toy data to give a visual representation of the line.
